“Extras” is a collection of items that may be useful to you. 

“Forms” include forms inherited from a preceding group that were originally provided by Debbie King of DeRiche. 

“CalendarProgram.java” is a calendar program (imagine that) downloaded from the Internet- so don’t blame us for any spelling errors in the code. It may be useful inspiration for improving on the functionality of our existing DeRiche calendar or for starting the calendar from scratch and taking a different approach.

“Calendar.docx” is an explanation of the intended purpose of the calendar and some suggestions for how to go about completing it.
