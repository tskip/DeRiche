# DeRiche
Continuation of the DeRiche project for Advanced Systems Project
This contains an accumulation of what myself and four other classmates worked on during the 2016 Fall Semester.
Our job was continue developing a note taking software application for a company that dealt with disabled adults.
The purpose of the application is for when employees of the company have finished taking care of one the adults 
for the day, they must record everything that happened that day to receive funding from Medicaid.
